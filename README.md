Hello World!

I have just completed my certificate in Data Analysis from Turning College and eager to jump into the industry.
In completing my certificate I have learned:
Excel,
SQL,
Tableau (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jessica.baxter/vizzes),
Python,
Statistical Analysis Methods, and
Presentation Skills.

I have compiled projects I have completed while completing my certificate to showcase what I have learned and what I can do.

I come from a scientific research background collecting, analyzing, and presenting data I have collected from experiments I have run.
I am eager and quick to learn new things.
I love being challenged and I hate being idle.
While my perfectionism might mean I take a little bit longer with tasks, it also means I am providing the best I can offer.

I hope together we can tackle any problem!
